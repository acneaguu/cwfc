%%This function is used to determine the fitness of a given set of
%%solutions specified by 'Xin'. The fitness consists of two parts: the
%%objective function and the constraint penalty. The first part is the
%%objective function which is the main factor for the optimisation. This
%%term is relevant when a set of solutions is feasible i.e. do not violate
%%the set constraints. The constraint penalty should penalise constraint
%%violations. The more constraints are violated, the higher the penalty
%%should be and thus the fitness is worse. 

%%'Xin' can be both a vector (only one particle) or a matrix (where each
%%particle is represented by a different row.
